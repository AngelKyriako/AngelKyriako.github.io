Hello World,

I am Angelos, a fellow programmer, currently working in Athens, Greece.

In this page you can find my thoughts on programming, maybe tutorials on stuff I pick up along the road and who knows what else. In here you will find yourself reading about javascript, node.js, C#, Unity,  C++, Unreal, Python, Java & android.

Feel free to write your thoughts or suggestions on a topic, with a comment below a post.
